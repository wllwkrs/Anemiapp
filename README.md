## About
Anemia is a problem experienced by several countries. Based on data from World Health Statistics 2023 by WHO, the total number of anemia increased significantly due to population growth, from 492.9 million in 2000 to 570.8 million in 2019.
Anemia is a condition where a person's body experiences a decrease or the number of red blood cells in the body is below normal limits. This can occur due to a lack of hemoglobin in the body, thus affecting the amount of red blood cell production.
Anemia is often closely related to nutritional deficiencies, especially deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid, because deficiencies in these substances can inhibit the production of red blood cells or cause less than normal red blood cells, which can cause anemia.

From this problem, our team provided a solution in the form of `AnemiApp`. `AnemiApp` is an application with the aim of preventing anemia in women, which consists of several main features, such as Cek Gejala, Kalkulator Nutrisi, and Pengingat. Cek Gejala feature will display several survey questions that will identify whether the user is anemic or not, based on the answers to these questions. Then, the Kalkulator Nutrisi feature will calculate how much nutrition the user needs based on gender, weight, height, age and activities carried out. Then, the Pengingat feature will display a notification to remind users suffering from anemia to regularly take Blood Supplement Tablets. With these features in AnemiApp, it is hoped that it can help prevent an increase in anemia cases and achieve global goals in the field of Good Health and Well Being.
